# Detached Window Enhancement Summary

## Issues Fixed:

### ✅ **1. Window Going Under Other Windows**
- **Solution**: Set `focused: true` and `state: 'normal'` in window creation

### ✅ **2. Controls Position**
- **Solution**: Moved theme and close buttons to top-right corner
- **Changed**: Position from center to `position: absolute; top: 12px; right: 12px;`
- **Style**: Smaller, more subtle controls (32x32px) with opacity effects

### ✅ **3. Small Time Display**
- **Solution**: Dramatically increased time font size from 2.5rem to 4rem
- **Enhanced**: Better text shadows and glow effects
- **Added**: Responsive design for smaller windows
